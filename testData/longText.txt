So small confession, I discovered at the start of week 4 that I had the wrong version of the Forensic Psychology textbook. I got the right one and skimmed the chapters I read from the wrong book and it was all very similar, so if I mention anything that wasn't in the book in my first 3 entries, that's why.

	I wasn't surprised that the text author feels forensic psychology is misunderstood more often than not. I was a little surprised that only 10% of forensic psychologists have ever done any sort of criminal profiling and that only 17% consider it to be a scientifically reliable practice. Now I think this surprise is understandable, shows like Criminal Minds are fun and exciting (and even felt like a reasonable extra source during Abnormal Psychology, provided you took everything they said with a huge grain of salt), and its the actors job to sell you that dramatized idea, but I think I assumed that it had just a little more basis in reality (obviously with less shooting and car chases!) But I guess I see now that they are much closer to lawyer-psychologists then crime fighting-psychologists.
	I am unsure about my feelings on the subject of Mens Rea (guilty mind, committing a wrongful act willingly or with purpose.) Especially in the (roper v. simmons, 2005) case where the 17 year old killed a girl with a great amount of premeditation, because he “was a minor and therefore would get away with it”, even bragging afterwards about the deed. Now Im not particularly fond of the death penalty so Simmons not getting it doesn't really bother me, but it seems shocking to me that he would be regarded as entirely unable to take moral responsibility for his actions.
	I'm interested in reading more about the topic of Therapeutic Jurisprudence, “The use of social science to study the extent to which a legal rule or practice promotes the psychological and physical well-being of the people it affects”. This idea seems to play heavily into the law of unintended consequences, judicial decisions can have subtle powers on the people effected by a ruling.
	I found “whores of the court” to be while well written, to be rather extremist in its views. One line that I found to be particularly questionable was “Are mental health professionals any more knowledgeable than you or I about whether a child has been abused in the home? About whether the child is better off removed from the home? About whether the child will grow up better under Mother's custody or under Father's? Of course not. How could they be?”. How can a person who has spent large amounts of time interacting with both the child and in some cases the parents not care about whats best for the child? It doesn't take a doctorate to tell if someone is an awful parent. Maybe I'm biased because my mother has professionally participated in a number of child custody cases. She has continued therapy with children in situations where they have or haven't been removed or given to one parent or the other. How can those experiences not make her more of an expert than a layperson?
	I agree that all of the verdicts reached using “recovered memories” were probably mistakes, and that there are undoubtedly people who are willing to use their “expertise” to make a quick buck at the expense of people and the system. But should that really condemn psychology and its involvement in our legal system as a whole?

	Since it would seem forensic psychology is simply a more law conscious version of normal psychology its not surprising the main differences between therapeutic and forensic assessments are actually minimal. The process consists mainly of an interview, personality tests, and other standard testing like IQ, as people with an IQ of bellow 70 are considered ineligible for the death penalty. However this is questionable because of the variety of things that can effect the scores of IQ tests. Because of the intense scrutiny that legal procedures undergo its important to use archival(?) information, and check with additional sources of information than just a subjects self report.
	Its surprising to me reading through the names of some of the tests that they preform how many I recognize. I can only assume I remember them from the numerous scoring books that my parents had laying around the house while I was growing up.
	Its really sad to read about the rates of mental illness of people inside the prison system. It seems that there has to be a better way to help these people than putting them into correctional facilities, especially given the effect prison time has on learning, and mental health. It sort of feels like we aren't doing enough to try and help these people find a place for themselves in society and instead are sticking them out of sight where we don't have to try and interact with them or help them get better.
	Criminogenic needs: the needs or goals that are fulfilled by offenders when they commit a crime. 90% of effective programs try targeting and eliminating these needs and promoting more social behavior.
	I was surprised to read that typically expert witnesses would try and teach the judge and jury about their topic of expertise and then the judge/jury would make their own conclusion about the subject matter of the case. While clearly in Hagens rhetoric we are supposed to believe that this is a pretty good way of doing things that has been taken over by these psychologists. It seems that while this would be ideal, in more technical cases it would be impossible. These days if the technical explanation of the evidence requires any more than a high school education many juries would be out of luck. Even as someone going into a Computer/information field if computer evidence was being presented and explained for a case by an “expert”, I would probably have trouble fallowing it, and unless it was dumb ed down to the point of irrelevance an untrained person would have zero luck.
	Im also not sure how I feel about Hagen's opinions on psychological damage in court cases. Its true that its probably something that is not very easy to find the truth about, but I also think that it plays an important part in our legal system because its true that some events can cause serious lasting psychological damage. Like when my older sister was in a car accident a few years back and her leg was broken, for more than a year afterwards it was incredibly stressful for her to be in a car or drive (the sounds of panic she would involuntarily make when something unexpected happened were kind of a give away).
	I will say I am behind Hagens statement that the damage caused by sexual harassment is often imperceptible to others, mostly because the dog statement was amusing to me, clearly in this case the woman involved just doesn't like dogs and somehow in her mind turned it to be about sexual harassment.
1/22/2015        Text Chapter 5: insanity and Competency      Hagen Ch 4: reading tea leaves
Im not surprised in the least that malingering is an issue in forensic psychology. My father has shared stories with me about when he did assessments for things like memory or certain learning disorders he would have people who came in and would manage to get scores like 7/50 because they didnt understand A) How those tests actually work, or B) that an average score even for someone with the condition being tested would be in the 25-30 /50 range.
Im surprised about the use of “Irresistible impulse” in these sorts of cases. How can you determine if an impulse was resistible or not? It seems that TV would have us believe that seriel killers are unable to resist their impulses to kill. And while I am not prepared to speculate on that topic, Im unsure about my feelings on the premise as a whole.
So looking at “irresistible impulse” it in terms of the “John and Lorena Bobbitt” case (penis getting cut off), generally speaking Im on board with her not necessarily being held completely responsible for her actions, and the PTSD flashback/anxiety attack theory seems to fit well especially given her psychosomatic abdominal pain. But still the entire scenario (maybe because its slightly comical, especially given johns attempted porn career afterwards) seems strange to me. Especially given that Lorena went on to assault her own mother at one point, its clear that while the rape and PTSD played a part in her actions, its likely she had a bad temper at the best of times.
As for the Serial Killer Jerry Brudos the explanation provided in the chapter read just like an episode of Criminal Minds (from the readings I understand the show is mostly fiction but looking at the histories of offenders in detail was always well written, real or otherwise), his mother forcing him to dress as a woman and him then proceeding to act out his hate for her on these other women. Since he was schizophrenic its obvious he was mentally ill, but since there is not a strong causal link between schizophrenia and violence it seems to me that his actions were more the result of his upbringing and general sociopath tendencies. His wife's rejection seems to have been a trigger. So while it seems reasonable for him to be able to plead GBMI, and its likely that it was an irresistible impulse for him, he was clearly a danger to others and his sentence was a fair one.
	I'm annoyed, Hagen is again asserting that there is no reason why a training, degrees, and licenses make someone more eligible to stand trial than a layperson would be. When ever is the average person a better judge of something than someone who has devoted years of study to a topic? Suppose for a moment we gave someone a textbook on childcare, and everything in that book is correct except for one chapter where they extol the virtues of shaking babies to calm them down. You would probably prefer to leave your child in the hands of someone who had not read that book. But that isn't the way education works, you learn a lot of different things from a lot of sources. So now instead you give someone a whole shelf of reading on childcare to do, including the book that supports shaking babies. So you know that they are knowledgeable on childcare from a wide range of sources, who would you leave your child with? Probably the person who received the education about childcare. Its the same for psychology. Because education comes from a variety of sources your unlikely to have one bad influence completely cloud your judgment, and you will be better able to make decisions in that field than a layperson.

January 29th Text chapter 4: criminal investigations, chapter 11: interrogations and confessions
	Here we go from the right textbook now, Criminal profiling and forensic psychology. Im not in any way surprised that the amount of interest in the subject greatly exceeds the positions that need filling. Just like Indiana Jones caused a spike in the number of students studying archaeology, or Jurassic Park caused a jump in interest in paleontology, its no surprise that students want to do exciting things like the characters on criminal minds.
	The discussion of stereotypes for criminals was thought provoking for me, There are so many logical fallacies that people fall for on such a regular basis that its not surprising that people don't really have a good idea of what criminals are actually like. All of the examples that the text lists are influenced by Hollywood. There are dozens of movies that portray bank robbers as clever, debonair, excreta (personally when I think of bank robbers stereotypes, the movie that comes to mind is John Cleese in A Fish Called Wanda, so I may be biased in an entirely different direction!) Although I felt my assumptions about their other examples were pretty spot.
	I am really appreciating this chapter, it feels like it is really trying its hardest to give a fair account of both the pros and cons of criminal profiling. That it can be used to build a accurate picture of what the offender “looks like” and can be validated statistically, but at the same time its very fallible and if used too heavily to direct the investigation can cause huge mistake to be made. Reading through various sections of this chapter it would seem that the script writers for some of the crime dramas that I have watched actually understand the process involved in criminal profiling, and while even though Hollywood/entertainment value comes first, some small amount of legitimacy was included.
	I think its really important to remember that when looking at the stereotypes surrounding criminal investigations that even though statistically significant numbers of abusers were abused as children that not everyone who was grows up to continue the cycle. Because I can imagine that if I were in that position, regardless of what I ended up doing, being told that its inevitable that I would abuse someone would make for some serious self hatred, while being told the opposite would probably be quite liberating.
	I wouldn't have guessed that forensic psychologists want law enforcement to change how it conducts its interrogations, although I will say that since I have zero first hand experience with the subject, any information on the topic could come as a surprise.
	In the Paul Ingram case, I protest the assertion by the text that as a father, family man, and specifically, a central member of a religious organization, he was the paragon of mainstream values. Even among all the flavors of religion I would say that Pentecostal is an exceedingly bizarre one, like pistachio. Reading through the case however does seem to suggest that there should be a re-evaluation of interrogation procedures. Or at the very least it makes me agree with the Supreme court justice they quoted at the start of the chapter, that a confession shouldn't hold any more weight than the actual evidence.
	I find the idea that police can lie in order to get a confession to be really unfair. While the two examples cited did lead to the right thing happening, it doesn't take a stretch of the imagination to come up with a scenario where if the same tactic is used on an innocent person they could make a false confession in an attempt to get leniency because as far as they know, there is false evidence against them. The book suggests that it is hard to tell how many people are wrongfully imprisoned on coerced impressions, however I would like to believe that we should make the system to work in such a way that it upholds the ideal that “its better for 10 guilty men to walk free than one innocent be wrongfully imprisoned.” However since this is clearly the attitude that our justice system is taking with rape accusations, and its not working so well there either, the problem is clearly more complex and I certainly don't have a good solution.
February 5th Forensic Psychology Chapter 3: Psychology and Law enforcement.
	The section of this chapter that opens by talking about the racial profiling done by many police officers just seems all to familiar. Given all of the current events over the last few months around police officers shooting black civilians, it would seem that whatever it is that forensic psychology has been doing to try and reduce racism in the police force hasn't been enough. Although more than likely there is very little that could have been done in these cases to stop it. No amount of screening can completely prevent corruption. The text says “expressions of brutality and corruption may well reflect a predisposition to lawbreaking within the individual officer”, now this may be true, the sentiment after Ferguson is very much one of “Cops are just criminals with badges” but I don't believe that's fair. Instead I attribute corruption to what Lord Acton once said, “Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.”
	The section on situational tests for police officers was quite interesting. Walking down a street and then being asked to make observations, or being observed while helping someone seem like great ways to determine how fit someone is to be an officer. Although the fact that they know these are tests means that the results aren't always going to be the same as they would be if they weren't being observed.
	I find the premise that police were reluctant to arrest a man for spousal assault because he would loose face very depressing. Abuse is abuse, there is no two ways about it.
	It would seem to me that a psychologist would be exceedingly valuable in a hostage situation. Part of (some) psychologists jobs is to provide a person with empathy and listen without making judgments, a quality that would be quite valuable in the tense adversarial environment of a hostage situation. Although Its hard to argue with the opinion that a psychologist with no training or field experience on the topic would probably end up doing more harm than good. Its not surprising that police don't consider face to face negotiation as a good option (or that Hollywood considers it the best option).
	Its shocking to me that even with such a stressful work environment, often high levels of alcoholism, and marital issues, that police officers don't consider therapy to be necessary or at least beneficial. I would have thought that as a culture we had moved away from this notion of needing therapy to be indicative of personal fault or weakness. Although since from what I understand most police officers have an alpha personality and need as much control of their environment as possible that maybe its not surprising that most would be uncomfortable with the concept of therapy and the loss of control that it, in their minds, represents.
	With so many public and school shootings in the last year its still unclear to me how to best address the issues (well other than stricter gun control regulations, that part is fairly clear). Better training for officers couldn't hurt, and better equipment is probably good, although some of the articles I have read that highlight the fact that many police armories include items like grenade launchers, that might not be the best direction to take.

Summary/Reflection
	Reading through my writings I have noticed a variety of things both about my opinions on forensic psychology and about myself. While I could probably have made this judgement after each week we read her work, I think it warrants a statement here that I have a hard time agreeing with Hagens opinions. I think that while she brings up a variety of valid points her apparent disdain for psychology seems to put me at odds with her on a personal level because of my parents being psychologists, and on an intellectual level because I strongly disagree with her continued assertions that psychologists don't know any better than the average person who is or is not fit to stand trial, or what is the best custody arrangement for a child. And while I understand quite logically that these things can be, or maybe even are often true (sometimes psychologists only see someone for a few hours to make the assessment), that this really isn't a fair judgment on the whole of psychologists who work with the courts. I think another part of my reluctance to buy into her views is that for better or worse I tend to consider humanity to be pretty OK. While there is a huge amount of evidence that as a whole we have done some awful things, are currently doing awful things, and will in all likelihood continue to do awful things far into the future, but on an individual basis most people are pretty OK, and aren't just in it for themselves. I'm not sure I have a logical basis for this belief, maybe its just what want to believe is true or what I tell myself so that I'm not depressed by all of my interactions with other people.
	Also from my writings its pretty clear to me that I have watched a few to many police shows and movies. Although the fact that I watched all 9 seasons of Criminal Minds on Netflix last term would also probably qualify as a strong indication. But I think despite the fact I brought the show up quite a few times in my writings, I do a fairly good job of not being taken in by the fictional aspects.
	It would also seem that I tend to be a little wishy washy on controversial subjects. The death penalty for the mentally ill, the death penalty in general, gun control. All of these things I brought up in my writings but then for the most part, refused to take a strong stance on one way or the other. (Even after I wrote that line, I noticed that I added “for the most part” so as to not be forced to make a statement on if I had made definitive statements on any of the above topics. Guess that's something I need to work on.) Maybe this is my version of impression management, trying to avoid committing myself to something that someone will disagree with and form an opinion about me based on.
	My impression of forensic psychology has mostly been a good one, I'm not sure I have an in depth enough understanding of the legal system to appreciate some of its subtleties though. I would like to learn more about the topic specifically the more wide ranging effects of some of the choices made regarding the way psychology is used in court. Although I must confess, I have some morbid fascination (albeit one that many people share) that means the topic of why people do awful things is a bit more interesting to read about than the specifics of their trials.
